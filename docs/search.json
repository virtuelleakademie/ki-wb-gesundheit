If you need examples, this might be a good place to start.\nThe strategies include:\n\nwriting clear instructions\nproviding reference texts\nsplitting tasks into subtasks\ngiving GPT ‘time to think’\nusing external tools\n\nSome general techniques are:\n\nNumbered Steps:: For sequential tasks, use numbered steps. This helps the model understand the sequence of actions.\nUse delimiters: To separate various parts of the prompt (e.g. \", `,, ', |, #, …).\nFew-shot prompting: Provide a few examples for guidance.\n\nCombining these techniques, a template prompt might look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate\n\n\n\n\nRole: who is being simulated?\nTask: what is to be done?\nSteps: what are the steps to complete the task?\nContext: what is the context of the task?\nGoal: what is the goal of the task?\nFormat: what is the format of the output? How long should it be?\n\n\n\nRemember to structure your prompt in a way that is clear and easy to understand. You can use markdown to format your prompt, and you instruct the mode to format its response using markdown.\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prompt:\n\n\n\nYou are an expert on the topic of university education and didactics. Explain the concept of “flipped classroom” to a group of teachers. Use markdown to format your response. Keep you explanation concise and to the point.\n\n\nDifferent persona:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prompt:\n\n\n\nYou are 13 year old high school student. Explain the concept of “flipped classroom” to your friends. Use markdown to format your response. Keep you explanation concise and to the point.\n\n\nAsk the model to output a table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prompt:\n\n\n\nYou are a high school teacher. Give me a table containing Greek letters in one column, their pronunciation in the second column, and examples of usage in the third column. Give me a maximum of 6 rows."
