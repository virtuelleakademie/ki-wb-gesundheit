:::{.callout-tip}
- In general, it is advisable to improve your prompting strategy by **iterating**. 

- Start with a simple prompt, see what the model generates, and then refine. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the results. 

- Once you have a good prompt, you can use it in a new chat session - in this way, the "failed" attempts will not be part of the context.
